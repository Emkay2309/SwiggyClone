# SwiggyClone - A React.js Food Ordering Application

This project is a simplified version of Swiggy, allowing users to browse through a selection of restaurants and place orders. It utilizes live data fetched from the Swiggy API, providing a real-world experience similar to using the actual Swiggy app.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).
- You have a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install NPM packages.

3. Since this application fetches data from the Swiggy API, you need to install the CORS Origin extension for your browser to bypass the same-origin policy restrictions.

4. Start the application.
  
5. Open `http://localhost:1234` in your browser to view the application.
  Before that ensure that you have any extension for Cross origin issue

## Usage

Navigate through the application to explore restaurants, view menus, add items to your cart, and simulate placing an order.
