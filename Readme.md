//Issue : 

Body.js
While fetching JSON --> we should use states variables instead of let/const coz it wont update the UI when the variable updates.


Mind.js
While using map inside JSX callback fn was not allowing to use {} , so used () instead --> error was that in that next page array elements were not rendering.
